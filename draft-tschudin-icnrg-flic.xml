            <t>This document describes a bare bones "index table"-approach for
                organizing a set of ICN data objects into a large, File-Like
                ICN Collection (FLIC).
                
                At the core of this collection is a so called manifest which acts as
                the collection's root node. The manifest contains an index table with
                pointers, each pointer being a hash value pointing to either a final
                data block or another index table node.</t>

        <section title="Introduction">
            
            <t>The purpose of a manifest is to concisely name the constiuent pieces of a larger object.
                A FLIC manifest does this by using a first manifest to name and cryptographically sign
                the data structure and then use more concise lists of hash-based names to indicate
                the constituent pieces.  This maintains strong security from a single signature.
                A Manifest entry gives one enough information to create an Interest for that entry,
                so it must specify the name, the hash digest, and if needed the locators (routing hints).
            </t>
            
            <t>A key question is how one names the root manifest, the application data, and
                other subsequent manifests.  The question of namespaces is specific to the names
                of each Content Object (CCNx) or Data (NDN), and is separate from the question of
                Locators.
                FLIC allows one to use a first namespace for the manifests and a second namespace
                for the application data.  A given namespace may use one of three schemas:
                hash-based naming, single-prefix naming, or segmented naming.
                We describe the allowed methods in  <xref target="namespaces"/>.
                There are also
                particulars of how to encode the name schema in a given ICN protocol, which we
                describe in <xref target="encodings"/>.
            </t>
            
            <t>Locators are routing hints to find a Content Object / Data.  They exist in both
                CCNx and NDN, though the specifics differ.  A FLIC manifest encodes locators the same
                for both ICN protocols, though they are encoded differently in the underlying protocol.  See <xref target="encodings"/> for encoding differences.
            </t>

            <t>We follow the <xref target="RFC8569">CCNx</xref> terminology where a
                Content Object is the data structure that holds application payload.
                It is made up of an optional Name, a PayloadType, a Payload, and
                an optional Signature.</t>
            <t>FLIC has encodings for <xref target="CCNxEncoding">CCNx encoding</xref>
                as per <xref target="RFC8609">RFC 8609</xref> and for <xref target="NDNEncoding">NDN</xref>.

        <section anchor="goals" title="Design Goals">
            <t>The preferred FLIC structure copies the proven UNIX inode concept
                of direct and indirect pointers, but without the specific structural forms of
                direct versus indirect.
            </t>
            <t>In FLIC terms, a direct pointer links to application-level data, which is
                a Content Object with application data in the Payload.
                An indirect pointer links to a Content Object with a FLIC Manifest in the
                Payload.
            </t>
            
            <t>Links in FLIC use hash-based naming of Content Objects, rather than inode
                block numbers.  Both CCNx and NDN support hash-based naming, though the
                details vary.  See <xref target="CCNxEncoding"/> and <xref target="NDNEncoding"/>.
                Another advantage of using hash-based naming is it permits block-level de-duplication of application data because two blocks with the
                same payload will have the same hash name.
            </t>
            
            <t>Because FLIC uses hash-based naming, FLIC graphs are inherently acyclic.</t>
            
            <t>The preferred FLIC structure includes a root manifest with a strong
                cryptographic signature and then strong hash names to other manifests
                (e.g. SHA256).  The advantage of this structure is the single signature
                in the root manifest covers the entire data structure no matter how many
                additional manifests are in the data structure.  Another advantage of
                this structure is it removes the need to use chunk (CCNx) or
                segment (NDN) name components for the subordinate manifests.
            </t>
            
            <t>FLIC supports manifest encryption separate from application payload encryption.  It has
                a flexible encryption envelope to support various encryption algorithms and
                key discovery mechanisms.  The byte layout allows for in-place encryption
                and decryption.</t>
            
            <t>A limitation of this approach is that one cannot construct a hash-based name
                for a child until one knows the payload of that child.  In practical terms,
                this means that one must have the complete application payload available
                at the time of manifest creation.
            </t>
            
            <t>FLIC's design allows straightforward applications that just need to traverse a linear set of related objects to do so simply, but FLIC has two extensibility mechanisms that allow for more sophisticated uses: manifest metadata, and pointer annotations. These are described in <xref target="metadata"/> and <xref target="annotations"/> respectively.

                <t>A manifest Node may define one or more Locator prefixes that can be used in the construction of Interests from the pointers in the manifest.  The Locators are inherited when walking a manifest tree, so they do not need to be defined everywhere.  It is RECOMMENDED that only the Root manifest contain Locators so that a single operation can update the locators.  One usecase when storing application payloads at different replicas is to replace the Root manifest with a new one that contains locators for the current replicas.

            <section anchor="namespaces" title="Namespaces">
                <t>A FLIC manifest may define zero or more namespaces.  If none are defined, FLIC uses the default Hash Naming approach.  If using namespaces, typically there are two defined:                    one for the manifest namespace and one for the application data namespace.  If the                    two are the same, they can share a namepace.  There may be more than two namespaces.
                </t>
                
                <t>A namespace follows a naming convention.  The naming convention governs how FLIC creates the ICN Name that goes in an Interest's Name and must match a Content Object / Data Name. The conventions are: (1) Hash Naming, (2) Single Prefix, and (3) Segmented Prefix. The default is to use Hash Naming.  Hash Naming does not include anything besides a hash name in the Interest's name and relies on the Locator to forward the Interest. Single Prefix uses the same name differntiated only by a Content Object's implicit hash. Segmented Prefix keeps a counter for the namespace, starting with 0, and increments it after each use of the namespace.
                </t>
                
                <t>The namespace definitions may be inherited from the Root manifest or the Top manifest, or any prior manifest.  It is RECOMMENDED that the namespace definitions appear in the Root manifest so they can be updated by a single operation.  Because Segmented Prefix namespaces use a counter, it is RECOMMENDED to only define them in the Root manifest or Top manifest and not elsewhere, as it may confuse the counters.
                </t>
                
                <t>In the NodeData, there may be zero or more NSDef contains. Each NSDef defines a namespace identifier (octet string) and its naming convention. For the Hash Naming convention, no further information is required. For the Single Prefix and Segmented Prefix conventions, the NSDef specifies the ICN Name prefix used by the namespace.

                <t>A HashGroup may have an NSRef container that indicates which namespace it is using, and by implication which naming convention and the corresponding prefix. If there is no NSRef, the hash group uses Hash Naming convention.

            <section anchor="metadata" title="Manifest Metadata">
            	<t>The FLIC Manifest may be extended by defining TLVs that apply to the Manifest as a whole, or alternatively, individually to every data object pointed to by the Manifest. This basic specification does not specify any, but metadata TLVs may be defined through additional RFCs or via Vendor TLVs.  FLIC uses a Vendor TLV structure similar to <xref target="RFC8609"/> for vendor-specific annotations that require no standardiation process.
            	</t>
            	
            	<t>For example, some applications may find it useful to allow specialized consumers such as <spanx>repositories</spanx> (for example <xref target="repository"/>) or enhanced forwarder caches to pre-place, or adaptively pre-fetch data in order to improve robustness of delay performance. We note in passing that FLICs use of separate namespaces for the Manifest and the underlying Data allows different encryption keys to be used, hence giving a element like a cache or repository access to the Manifest data does not as a side effect reveal the contents of the application data itself.

            <section anchor="annotations" title="Pointer Annotations">
                <t>FLIC allows each manifest pointer to be annotated with extra data. Annotations allow applications to exploit metadata about each Data Object pointed to without having to first fetch the corresponding Content Object. This specification defines one such annotation. The <spanx>SizeAnnotation</spanx> specifies the number of application layer octets covered by the pointer.
                </t>
                
                <t>An annotation may, for example, give hints about a preferred traversal order for fetching the data, or an importance/precedence indication to aid applications that do not require every content object pointed to in the manifest to be fetched. This can be very useful for real-time or streaming media applications that can perform error concealment when rendering the media.
                </t>
                
                <t>Additional annotations may be defined through additional RFCs or via Vendor TLVs.  FLIC uses a Vendor TLV structure similar to <xref target="RFC8609"/> for vendor-specific annotations that require no standardiation process.

            <section anchor="grammar" title="Manifest Grammar (ABNF)">
                <t>The manifest grammar is mostly independent of the transport ICN protocol. The TLV encoding therefore follows the corresponding ICN protocol, so for CCNx FLIC uses 2 octet length, 2 octet type and for NDN uses the 1/3/5 octet types and lengths.  There are also some differences in how one structures and resolves links. <xref target="RFC8569"/> defines HashValue and Link for CCNx encodings. The NDN ImplicitSha256DigestComponent defines HashValue and NDN Delegation (from Link Object) defines Link for NDN. The <xref target="encodings"/> section below specifies these differences.
                </t>
                
                <t>The basic structure of a FLIC manifest is a security context, a node, and an authentication tag.  The security context and authentication tag are not needed if the node is unencrypted.  A node is made up of a set of metadata, the NodeData, that applies to the entire node, and one or more HashGroups that contain pointers.
                </t>
                
                <t>The NodeData element defines the namespaces used by the manifest. There may be multiple namespaces, depending on how one names subsequent  manifests or data objects.  Each HashGroup may reference a single namespace to control how one forms Interests from the HashGroup.  If one is using separate namespaces for manifests and application data, one needs at least two HashGroups.  For a manifest structure of "MMMDDD," for example, one would have a first hash group for the child manifests with its namespace and a second HashGroup for the data pointers with the other namespace. If one used a structure like "MMMDDDMMM," then one would need three HashGroups.

                    The second is an RSA key encapsulation mechanisms.
                    The third is a group encryption mechanism, where the Top manifest specifies how a group member
                    may fetch the decryption keys.

                        The KeyNum identifies a key on the receiver. The key must be of the correct length of the Mode used.
                        If the key is longer, use the left bits. Many receivers many have the same key with the same KeyId.
                        A publisher creates a signed root manifest with a security context. A consumer must ensure that the

                        with many other consumers. The publisher may use either method 8.2.1 (deterministic IV) or 8.2.2
                        (RBG-based IV) [NIST 800-38D] for creating the IV.

                        Manifest objects can be fetched and decrypted in any order. This design also ensures that

                        (CEK) and a key wrapping pair with a Key Encryption Key (KEK) and Key Decryption Key (KDK).
                        Each publisher and consumer has its own public/private key pair, and the KM knows each publisher's
                        and consumer's identity and its public key (PK_x).

                        We do not describe the publisher-key manager protocol to request a CEK. The publisher will obtain

                        precursor, Z, encrypted with the KEK (an RSA operation), and the KeyId of the corresponding KDK,
                        and the Locator is the CCNx name prefix to fetch the KDK (see below). The precursor Z is chosen
                        randomly z &lt; n-1, where n is KEK's public modulus. Note that CEK = KDF(Z). Note that the publisher
                        does not see KEK or Z.

                    <t>
                        We use HKDF (RFC 5869) for the KDF. CEK = HKDF-Expand(HKDF-Extract(0, Z), "CEK", KeyLen),

                        how the manifest is encrypted with AES-GCM.  The WrappedKey is the AES key to decrypt the manifest.
                        The LocatorPrefix is used to construct an Interest to fetch the KDK.

                        To fetch the KDK, a consumer with public key PK_c constructs an Interest with name
                        /LocatorPrefix/{KeyId}/{PK_c keyid} and a KeyIdRestriction of the KM's KeyId (from the LocatorPrefix Link).
                        It should receive back a signed Content Object with the KDK wrapped for the consumer, or a NAK from the KM.
                        The payload of the ContentObject will be RsaKemWrap(PK, KDK). The signed ContentObject must have a
                        KeyLocator to the KM's public key. The consumer will trust the KM's public key because the publisher,
                        whom the consumer trusts, relayed that KeyId inside its own signed Manifest.

                        Recommended Cache Time, or if caching of the response is even permissible. The KM may require on-line

                        We use an EC group key that is encrypted for each user under their public key (also assumed EC) using
                        a standard NIST wrapping C(1e, 2s, ECC CDH)-ECDSA plus AES-KWP.  When a publisher wants to publish,
                        it creates an EC wrapping keypair and publishes the private key wrapped under the group key
                        (use C(1e, 1s, ECC CDH)-ECDSA plus AES-KWP).  Finally, the publisher starts creating master
                        secrets by creating ECDHE-ECDSA offers under the wapping key and using a KDF (e.g. HMAC-SHA256)
                        for the data key.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Note that the offer, in this case, is just an ephemeral EC public key plus the curve specification.
                        In compressed form that EC public key is only 48 bytes (SECP384R1), so the whole offer is maybe 60 bytes
                        including TLV encoding.  Compare that to an RSA 4096-bit encryption of a 32-byte AES key at 512 bytes.
                        That's over an 8x improvement.

                    <t>
                        The complete security context would be larger, as you still need the keyid of the wrapping key
                        (32 bytes) plus a link to the wrapping key content object.  Once someone has the wrapping key, they
                        can verify the key id and avoid fetching anything, then calculate the shared secret from the ECDHE
                        offer, then derive the data key using a KDF.   For IoT use cases, it would be useful to be able to
                        link to the whole offer.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The KDF is tied to input from the manifest, so the publisher can create many data keys so each
                        FLIC manifest tree has a different key all from the same master key derived from the wrapping key.
                        The offers could be embedded in the root manifest or published externally.  The preferred method

                        When the group key changes, a publisher only needs to re-encrypt the wrapping keys.
                        It can save a lot of work depending on how many items it used the wrapping key under that group key.
                        For example, if the publisher uses only one wrapping key per group key, then they only need to re-encrypt one
                        thing for the new group to have access to the old data.

                        This works with RSA keys too, though the specific algorithms change some.  We would use RSA-OAEP instead of
                        the ECDHE method.

                        data namespace are the same and could use the same NSDef.  It also means that the Data
                        name is empty (0-length).

                        This means the consumer must maintain a counter for each namespace.  It will also remove the
                        possibility of doing some name-based data de-duplication.  OPTIONAL: Use AnnotatedPointers
                        to indicate the segment number of each hash pointer to avoid needing to infer the segment numbers.

            <t>This section describes one method to build trees.  It constructs a pre-order tree in a single pass
                of the application data, going from the tail to the beginning.
                This allows us to work up the right side of the tree in a single pass, then work down each left
                branch until we exhaust the data.  Using the reverse-order traversal, we create the right-most-child
                manifest, then its parent, then the indirect pointers of that parent, then the parent's direct pointers,
                then the parent of the parent (repeating). This process uses recursion,
                as it is the clearest way to show the code. A more optimized approach could do it in a true single pass.
            </t>
            
            <t>
                Because we're building from the bottom up, we use the term 'level' to be the distance from the
                right-most child up. Level 0 is the bottom-most level of the tree, such as where node 7 is:
