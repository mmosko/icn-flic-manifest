      <t>This document describes a simple "index table" data structure and its associated
        Information Centric Networking (ICN) data objects for organizing a set of primitive ICN data
        objects into a large, File-Like ICN Collection (FLIC). At the core of this collection is a
          <em>manifest</em> which acts as the collection's root node. The manifest contains an index
        table with pointers, each pointer being a hash value pointing to either a final data block
        or another index table node.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>ICN architectures, such as Content-Centric Networking (CCNx)<xref target="RFC8569"
          format="default"/> and Named Data Networking <xref target="NDN" format="default"/>, are
        well suited for static content distribution. Each piece of (possibly immutable) static
        content is assigned a name by its producer. Consumers fetch this content using said name.
        Optionally, consumers may specify the full name of content, which includes its name and a
        unique (with overwhelming probability) cryptographic digest of said content.
        <!--      (See <xref target="RFC7927" format="default"/> for a formal definition of "full name".) -->
      </t>

      <aside>
        <t>Note: The reader is assumed to be familiar with general ICN concepts from CCNx or NDN.
          For general ICN terms, this document uses the terminology defined in <xref
            target="RFC7927" format="default"/>. Where more specificity is needed, we utilize <xref
            target="RFC8569" format="default">CCNx</xref> terminology where a Content Object is the
          data structure that holds application payload.
          <!--	Therefore, it comprises an optional Name, a PayloadType, a Payload, and an optional Signature. -->
          Terms defined specifically for FLIC are enumerated below in <xref target="Terminology"
          />.</t>
      </aside>

      <t>To enable requests with full names, consumers need a priori knowledge of content digests.
        A Manifest, a form of catalog, is a data structures commonly employed to store and transport
        this information. Typically, ICN manifests are signed content objects (data) which carry a
        collection of hash digests. As content objects, a manifest itself may be
        fetched by full name. A manifest may contain either hash digests of, or pointers to,
        either other manifests or content objects. A collection of manifests and content objects
        represents a large piece of application data, e.g., one that cannot otherwise fit in a
        single content object.  Because a manifest contains a collection of hashes, it is by
        definition non-circular because one cannot hash the manifest before filling it in.</t>

      <t>Structurally, this relationship between manifests and content objects is reminiscent of the
        UNIX inode concept with index tables and memory pointers. In this document, we specify a
        simple, yet extensible, manifest data structure called FLIC - <em>File-Like ICN
          Collection</em>. FLIC is suitable for ICN protocol suites such as CCNx and NDN. We
        describe the FLIC design, grammar, and various use cases, e.g., ordered fetch, seeking,
        de-duplication, extension, and variable-sized encoding. We also include FLIC encoding
        examples for CCNx and NDN.</t>

      <t>The purpose of a manifest is to concisely name, and hence point to, the constiuent pieces
        of a larger object. A FLIC manifest does this by using a <em>root</em> manifest to name and
        cryptographically sign the data structure and then use concise lists of hash-based names to
        indicate the constituent pieces. This maintains strong security from a single signature. A
        Manifest entry gives one enough information to create an <em>Interest</em> for that entry,
        so it must specify the name, the hash digest, and if needed, the locators.</t>


      <t>FLIC is a distributed data structure illustrated by the following picture.</t>

      <t>A key design decision is how one names the root manifest, the application data, and
        subsidiary manifests. FLIC uses the concept of a Name Constructor. The root
        manifest (in fact, any FLIC manifest) may include a Name Constructor that instructs a
        manifest reader how to properly create Interests for the associated application data and
        subsidiary manifests. The Name Constructors allow interest construction using a well-known,
        application-independent set of rules. Some name constructor forms are tailored towards
        specific ICN protocols, such as CCNx or NDN; some are more general and could work with many
        protocols. We describe the allowed Name Constructor methods in <xref
          target="nameconstructors" format="default"/>. There are also particulars of how to encode
        the name schema in a given ICN protocol, which we describe in <xref target="encodings"
          format="default"/>.</t>


      <t>FLIC has encodings for <xref target="CCNxEncoding" format="default">CCNx</xref> as per
          <xref target="RFC8609" format="default">RFC 8609</xref> and for <xref target="NDNEncoding"
          format="default">NDN</xref>.  For the implementor, the section <xref target="CCNxTlvs"/> 
          succintly defines the CCNx TLV structures and the format of each TLV value.</t>

      <section>
        <name>FLIC as an ICN experimental tool</name>
        <t>FLIC enables experimentation with how to structure and retrieve large data objects and
          collections in ICN. By having a common data structure applications can rely on, with a
          common library of code that can be used to create and parse manifest data structures,
          applications using ICN protocols can both avoid unnecessary reinvention and also have
          enhanced interoperability. Since the design attempts to balance simplicity, universality,
          and extensibility, there are a number of important experimental goals to achieve that may
          wind up in conflict with one another. We provide a partial list of these experimental
          issues in <xref target="experiments"/>. It is also important for users of FLIC to
          understand that some flexibility and extensions might be removed if use cases do not
          materialize to justify their inclusion in an eventual standard.</t>

    <section anchor="overview">
      <name>Design Overview</name>
      <t>The FLIC design adopts the proven UNIX inode concept of direct and indirect pointers, but
        without the specific structural forms of direct versus indirect. FLIC is a collection of
        pointers, and when one de-references the pointer it could be an application object or
        another FLIC manifest.
        The pointers in FLIC use
        hash-based naming of Content Objects analogous to the function block numbers play in UNIX
        inodes. </t>

      <t> Because FLIC uses hash-based pointers as names, FLIC graphs are inherently acyclic. Both
        CCNx and NDN support hash-based naming, though the details differ (see <xref
          target="CCNxEncoding" format="default"/> and <xref target="NDNEncoding" format="default"
          />).</t>

      <t>The FLIC datastructure is an acyclic digraph of Content Objects.  In this document, our
        examples are trees, but that is not a requirement.  For example, a de-duplication
        representation might have a common object with many 0s and that object could be
        references from multiple places in the tree.  As another example, there could be
        a common sub-collection of objects organized in a Manifest, and that sub-manifest
        could be included in multiple places.</t>

      <t>In FLIC terms, a direct pointer links to application-level data, which is a Content Object
        with application data in the Payload. An indirect pointer links to a Content Object with a
        FLIC Manifest in the Payload.</t>

      <aside>
        <t>Note: A substantial advantage of using hash-based naming is that it permits block-level
          de-duplication of application data because two blocks with the same payload will have the
          same hash name. </t>
      </aside>

      <t>The FLIC structure that is expected most applications would use consists of a root
        manifest with a strong cryptographic signature and then cryptographically strong (e.g.
        SHA256 <xref target="SHS"/>) hash names as pointers to other manifests. The advantage of
        this structure is that the single signature in the root manifest covers the entire data
        structure no matter how many additional manifests are in the data structure. Another
        advantage of this structure is it removes the need to use chunk (CCNx) or segment (NDN) name
        components for the subordinate manifests.</t>

      <t>Another usage is to have a signed Root Manifest with a single pointer to the Top Manifest.
      The Top Manifest maybe a CCNx Nameless object.  This method allows an intermediary service to respond
      to client requests with its own signed Manifest that then points to a small Root manifest.
      The client trusts the intermediary's reponse because of the intermediary's signature, and then
      trusts the content because of the Root manifest.  In some cases, the intermediary could
      embed the Root Manifest (because it is small) and avoid additional round trips before
      beginning download.  This technique is used in a
        <xref target="ProjectOrigin">peer-to-peer sharing protocol</xref>.</t>

      <t>FLIC supports manifest encryption separate from application payload encryption (See <xref
          target="encryption"/>). It has a flexible encryption envelope to support various
        encryption algorithms and key discovery mechanisms. The byte layout allows for in-place
        encryption and decryption.</t>

      <t>A limitation of this approach is that one cannot construct a hash-based name for a child
        until one knows the payload of that child. In practical terms, this means that one must have
        the complete application payload available at the time of manifest creation.</t>

      <t>FLIC's design allows straightforward applications that just need to traverse a linear set
        of related objects to do so simply, but FLIC has two extensibility mechanisms that allow for
        more sophisticated uses: manifest metadata, and pointer annotations. These are described in
          <xref target="metadata" format="default"/> and <xref target="annotations"/>
        respectively.</t>

      <t anchor="libraries">FLIC goes to considerable lengths to allow creation and parsing by
        application-independent library code. Therefore, any options used by applications in the
        data structure or encryption capabilities MUST NOT require applications to have
        application-specific Manifest traversal algorithms. This ensures that such application
        agnostic libraries can always successfully parse and traverse any FLIC Manifest by ignoring
        the optional capabilities.</t>

          <dd>a CCNx ContentObject with PayloadType 'Manifest' and a Payload of the encoded

          <dd>a metric used to measure the amount of waste in a manifest tree. Waste is the number

          <dt>Top Manifest:</dt>
          <dd>One useful manifest structure is to use a Root manifest that points to a single

            used to organize manifests. It is also possible to elide the two and use only a root
            manifest that also serves in the role of the top manifest.</dd>

      </section>

      <section anchor="locators">
        <name>Locators</name>

        <t>Locators are routing hints used by forwarders to get an Interest to a node in the network
          that can resolve the Interest's name. In some naming conventions, the name might only be a
          hash-based name so the Locator is the only available routing information. Locators exist
          in both CCNx and NDN, though the specific protocol mechanisms differ. A FLIC manifest
          represents locators in the same way for both ICN protocols inside <xref
            target="nameconstructors" format="default">Name Constructors</xref>, though they are encoded
          differently in the underlying protocol. See <xref target="encodings" format="default"/>
          for encoding differences.</t>

          <t>CCNx only uses locators with nameless objects, whereas NDN may use multiple ForwardingHints
            per interest.</t>

        <t>A name constructor definition may define one or more Locator prefixes that can be used in the
          construction of Interests from the pointers in the manifest. The Locators are inherited
          when walking a manifest tree, so they do not need to be defined everywhere. It is
          RECOMMENDED that only the Root manifest contain Locators so that a single operation can
          update the locators. One use case when storing application payloads at different replicas
          is to replace the Root manifest with a new one that contains locators for the current
          replicas.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="nameconstructors">
        <name>Name Constructors</name>
        <t>A Manifest may define zero or more name constructors in NameConstructorDefinitions (NCD)
          located in the Manifest Node. An NCD associates a Name Constructor Id (NCID) to a Name
          Constructor. The NCID is used in other parts of the Manifest to refer to that specific
          definition.</t>

        <t>A manifest organizes pointers inside Hash Groups.  Each Hash Group uses an NCID to
        indicate what Name Constructor to use to fetch the pointers inside the group.</t>

        <t>NCID 0 is the default name constructor. If it is not defined in an NCD, it is assumed to
          be a HashNamingConstructor. A Manifest may re-define the default as needed.</t>

        <t>A Manifest MUST use locally unique NCIDs in the NCD.</t>

        <t>NCDs and their associated NCIDs are inherited as one traverses a manifest. That is, a
          manifest consumer must remember the NCDs as it traverses manifests. If it encounters a
          HashGroup that uses an unknown NCID, the RECOMMENDED action is to report a malformed
          manifest to the user.</t>

        <t>A Manifest may update an NCID. If a child manifest re-defines an NCID, the manifest
          consumer MUST use the new definition from that point forward under that Manifest
          branch.</t>

        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that only the root or similar top-level manifest define NCDs and they
          not be re-defined in subsequent manifests.</t>
        <t>We expect that an application constructing a Manifest will take one of three approaches
          to name constructors. The advantage of using, or re-defining, the default name constructor
          is that any hash groups that use it do not need to specify an NCID and thus might save
          some space.</t>

        <ul>
          <li>A manifest might define (or use) a default name constructor and mix subsequent
            Manifest and Data objects under that same namespace. The manifest only needs to use one
            Hash Group and can freely mix Manifest and Data pointers.</li>
          <li>
            <t>A manifest might define (or use) a default name constructor for subsequent Manifests
              and define a second NCD for the application data. This places all subsequent manifests
              under the default constructor and places all application data under the second NCD.
              The Manifest must use at least two Hash Groups.</t>
            <t>There are a few options on how to organize the Hash Groups:</t>
            <ol type="(%d)" spacing="compact">
              <li>Manifest Hash Group followed by Data Hash group,</li>
              <li>Data Hash Group followed by Manifest Hash Group,</li>
              <li>Intermix multiple manifest and data hash groups for interleaved reading, or</li>
              <li>use a data-on-leaf only approach: the interior manifests would use the manifest
                hash group and the leaves would use the data hash group. Other organizations are
                possible.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Define multiple NCDs for subsequent manifests and data, or not use the default NCD, or
            use some other organization.</li>
        </ul>

        <t>In this specification, we define the following four types of Name Constructors.
          Additional name constructor types may be specified in a subsequent revision of the
          specification. Here, we informally define the name constructors. <xref target="grammar"/>
          specifies the encoding of each name constructor.</t>

          <dd>The NCD specifies a <tt>name</tt>, which will appear in every content object for
          that name constructor.  The comsumer uses it in an interest with the appropriate
          hash.  The NCD may specify locators, which NDN uses as ForwardingHints.  They are not
          used by CCNx, as these are not nameless objects.</dd>

          <dt>Type 3 (Segmented Naming):</dt>
          <dd>As in Type 2, but the consumer MUST track Segment Numbers.  If the Hash Group provides
          Segment Number annotations for each pointer, it MUST use those numbers.  Otherwise, the
          consumer MUST use a 0-based counter that follows the traversal order.  The publisher
          MAY include a <tt>StartSegmentId</tt> field in the group data to indicate the index
          of the first hash pointer of the group.</dd>
        </dl>

        <t>In Type 0, the consumer uses some name N to fetch a manifest.  When the consumer receives
        the Manifest back, it begins issuing interests for the content using the same name N, but with
        the hash pointers from the manifest.</t>

        <t>In Type 1, the consumer uses some name N to fetch a manifest.  The consumer receives a
        manifest back with name M inside the Manifest Content Object.  The consumer then uses the
        name M plus hash pointers from the manifest.</t>

        <t>In Type 2, the consumer receives a manifest and begins traversing it.  If it visits a
          Hash Group with a PrefixSchema Name Constructor, then that Name Constructor provides the name
          to use, plus optional NDN forwarding hints.</t>

        <t>In Type 3, if a Hash Group has a SegmentedSchema Name Constructor, then
          the consumer uses the same mechanism as Type 2, but with the addition
        of a Segment Number in the name.  Segmented naming is only compatible with deterministic
        traversal orders or if the Manifest provides Segment Number annotations or a StartSegmentId.</t>

      <section anchor="metadata">
        <name>Manifest Metadata</name>
        <t>The FLIC Manifest may be extended by defining TLVs that apply to the Manifest as a whole,
          or alternatively, individually to every data object pointed to by the Manifest. This basic
          specification does not specify any, but metadata TLVs may be defined through additional
          RFCs or via Vendor TLVs. FLIC uses a Vendor TLV structure identical to <xref
            target="RFC8609" format="default"/> for vendor-specific annotations that require no
          standardization process.</t>

        <t>For example, some applications may find it useful to allow specialized consumers such as
            <em>repositories</em> (for example <xref target="repository"/>) or enhanced forwarder
          caches to pre-place, or adaptively pre-fetch data in order to improve robustness and/or
          retrieval latency. Metadata can supply hints to such entities about what subset of the
          compound object to fetch and in what order.</t>

        <aside>
          <t>Note: FLICs ability to use separate namespaces for the Manifest and the underlying Data
            allows different encryption keys to be used, hence giving a network element like a cache
            or repository access to the Manifest data does not as a side effect reveal the contents
            of the application data itself.</t>
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section anchor="annotations">
        <name>Pointer Annotations</name>
        <t>FLIC allows each manifest pointer to be annotated with extra data. Annotations allow
          applications to exploit metadata about each Data Object pointed to without having to first
          fetch the corresponding Content Object. This specification defines three annotations:
          <tt>SizeAnnotation</tt>, <tt>SegmentIdAnnotation</tt>, and <tt>NameAnnotation</tt>.</t>


          <t>The <em>SizeAnnotation</em> specifies the number of application layer octets covered by
          the pointer.</t>

          <t>The <em>SegmentIdAnnotation</em> is a unique suffix for the pointer for use with
          the Seegmented Schema name constructor.  Use annotations allows non-sequential segment IDs, which
          could happen if manifest trees are named in the traversal order.</t>

          <t>The <em>NameAnnotation</em> is a full name of the pointer (less the pointer itself).
          For NDN, the poitner would be appended to the name for a complete name.  In CCNx, the name would
          be used in the Interest along with the pointer in the ContentObjectHashRestriction field.</t>

        <t>Other annotation may, for example, give hints about a desirable traversal order for fetching
          the data, or an importance/precedence indication to aid applications that do not require
          every content object pointed to in the manifest to be fetched. This can be very useful for
          real-time or streaming media applications that can perform error concealment when
          rendering the media.</t>

        <t>Additional annotations may be defined through additional specifications or via Vendor TLVs.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="grammar"><name>Manifest Grammar (ABNF)</name>
        <t>The manifest grammar is mostly, but not entirely independent of the ICN protocol used to
          encode and transport it. The TLV encoding therefore follows the corresponding ICN
          protocol, so for CCNx FLIC uses 2 octet length, 2 octet type and for NDN uses the 1/3/5
          octet types and lengths (see <xref target="NDNTLV"/> for details). There are also some
          differences in how one structures and resolves links. <xref target="RFC8609"
            format="default"/> defines HashValue and Link for CCNx encodings. The NDN
          ImplicitSha256DigestComponent defines HashValue and NDN Delegation (from Link Object)
          defines Link for NDN. <xref target="encodings"/> below specifies these differences.</t>

        <t>The basic structure of a FLIC manifest comprises a security context, a node, and an
          authentication tag. The security context and authentication tag are not needed if the node
          is unencrypted. A node is made up of a set of metadata, the <tt>NodeData</tt>, that
          applies to the entire node, and one or more <tt>HashGroups</tt> that contain pointers.</t>

        <t>The <tt>NodeData</tt> element defines the namespaces used by the manifest. There may be
          multiple namespaces, depending on how one names subsequent manifests or data objects. Each
            <tt>HashGroup</tt> may reference a single namespace to control how one forms Interests
          from the <tt>HashGroup</tt>. If one is using separate namespaces for manifests and
          application data, one needs at least two hash groups. For a manifest structure of
          "MMMDDD," (where M means manifest (indirect pointer) and D means data (direct pointer))
          for example, one would have a first <tt>HashGroup</tt> for the child manifests with its
          namespace and a second <tt>HashGroup</tt> for the data pointers with the other namespace.
          If one used a structure like "MMMDDDMMM," then one would need three hash groups.</t>

          <t>FLIC manifests use a pre-order traversal. This means they are read top to bottom, left
            to right. The algorithms in <xref target="pseudocode"/> show the pre-order forward
            traversal code and the reverse-order traversal code, which we use below to construct
            such a tree. This document does not mandate how to build trees. <xref

            trees.</t>

      <section anchor="encryption">
        <name>Manifest Encryption Modes</name>
        <t>This document specifies two encryption modes. The first is a preshared key mode, where
          the parties are assumed to have the decryption keys already. It uses AES-GCM or AES-CCM.
          This is useful, for example, when using a key agreement protocol such as <xref
            target="I-D.wood-icnrg-ccnxkeyexchange">CCNxKE</xref>. 
            The second is an RSA key
          wrapping mode using RSA-OAEP, similar to <xref target="RFC8017"/>. This may be used for group
          keying. </t>

        <t>Additional modes may be defined in subsequent specifications. We expect that an RSA-KEM 
          mode and Elliptic Curve mode should be specified.</t>

        <t>For group key based encryption, FLIC uses RSA-OAEP to wrap the <tt>WrappedKey</tt> element. 
          This specification only details the
          pertinent aspects of the encryption. It describes how a consumer locates the appropriate
          keys in the ICN namespace. It does not specify aspects of a key manager which may or may
          not be used as part of key distribution and management, nor does it specify the protocol
          between a key manager and a publisher. In its simpliest form, the publisher could be the
          key manager, in which case there is no extra protocol needed between the publisher and key
          manager.</t>

        <t>The manifest is always encrypted with an AEAD algorithm.  The difference between the
          preshared key mode and the RSA wrapped mode is how the parties communicate the AES 
          decryption key.  The group key mechanism facilitates the
          distribution of the shared key without an on-line key agreement protocol like (the expired
          draft) <xref target="I-D.wood-icnrg-ccnxkeyexchange">CCNxKE</xref>.</t>

        <section anchor="aead">
          <name>AEAD Mode</name>
          <t>This mechanism uses <xref target="AESGCM">AES-GEM</xref> or <xref target="RFC3310"
              >AES-CCM</xref> for manifest encryption. A publisher creating a <tt>SecurityCtx</tt>
            SHOULD use the mechanisms in <xref target="RFC6655"/> for AES-CCM IV generation and
            <xref target="RFC5288"/>
            for AES-GCM IV generation.</t>

          <t>When the publisher and consumer establish the KeyNum, they SHOULD also establish a salt.
            This results in a 4-byte salt and 8-byte nonce.  If no salt exists, the AEADNonce
            may be the entire IV.
          </t>

          <t>As these references specify, it is essential that the publisher creating a Manifest
            never use a Nonce more than once for the same key. For keys exchanged via a session
            protocol, such as CCNx, the publisher MUST use unique nonces on each Manifest for that
            session. If the key is derived via a group key mechanism, the publisher MUST ensure that
            the same Nonce is not used more than once for the same Content Encryption Key.</t>

          <t>The AEAD Mode uses <xref target="RFC5116"/> defined symbols AEAD_AES_128_CCM,
            AEAD_AES_128_GCM, AEAD_AES_256_CCM and AEAH_AES_256_GCM to specify the key length and
            algorithm.</t>

          <t> The <tt>KeyNum</tt> identifies a key on the receiver. The key MUST be exactly of the
            length specific by the Mode. Many receivers may have the same key with the same
              <tt>KeyNum</tt>.</t>

          <t>When a Consumer reads a manifest that specifies a <tt>KeyNum</tt>, the consumer SHOULD
            verify that the Manifest's publisher is an expected one for the KeyNum's usage. This
            trust mechanism employed to ascertain whether the publisher is expected is beyond the
            scope of this document, but we provide an outline of one such possible trust mechanism.
            When a consumer learns a shared key and <tt>KeyNum</tt>, it associates that
              <tt>KeyNum</tt> with the publisher ID used in a public key signature. When the
            consumer receives a signed manifest (e.g. the root manifest of a manifest tree), the
            consumer matches the KeyNum's publisher with the Manifest's publisher.</t>

          <t> Each encrypted manifest node has a full security context (<tt>KeyNum, Nonce,
            Mode</tt>). The AEAD decryption is independent for each manifest so Manifest objects can
            be fetched and decrypted in any order. This design also ensures that if a manifest tree
            points to the same subtree repeatedly, such as for deduplication, the decryptions are
            all idempotent.</t>

          <t>To encrypt a Manifest, the publisher:</t>
          <ol>
            <li>Removes any <tt>SecurityCtx</tt> or <tt>AuthTag</tt> from the Manifest.</li>
            <li>Creates a <tt>SecurityCtx</tt> and adds it to the Manifest.</li>
            <li>Treats the Manifest TLV through the end of the Node TLV Length as unencrypted
              authenticated Header. That includes anything from the start of the Manifest up to but
              not including the start of the Node's body.</li>
            <li>Treats the body of the Node to the end of the Manifest as encrypted data.</li>
            <li>Appends the AEAD <tt>AuthTag</tt> to the end of the Manifest, increasing the
              Manifest's length</li>
            <li>Changes the TLV type of the Node to <tt>EncryptedNode</tt>.</li>
          </ol>

          <t>To decrypt a Manifest, the consumer:</t>
          <ol>
            <li>Verifies that the <tt>KeyNum</tt> exists and the publisher is trusted for that
                <tt>KeyNum</tt>.</li>
            <li>Saves the <tt>AuthTag</tt> and removes it from the Manifest, decreasing the Manifest
              length.</li>
            <li>Changes the <tt>EncryptedNode</tt> type to <tt>Node</tt>.</li>
            <li>Treats everything from the Manifest TLV through the end of the Node Length as
              unencrypted authenticated Header. That is, all bytes from the start of the Manifest up
              to but not including the start of the Node's body.</li>
            <li>Treats the body of the Node to the end of the Manifest as encrypted data.</li>
            <li>Verifies and decrypts the data using the key and saved <tt>AuthTag</tt>.</li>
            <li>If the decryption fails, the consumer SHOULD notify the user and stop further
              processing of the manifest.</li>

            "CCNx Hash Function Types".</t>

            <t>The <tt>RsaOaepData</tt> includes an <tt>AEADData</tt> that indicates how to use the warpped key to
            decrypt the manifest.  It optionally includes the wrapped key itself.  A publisher
            using <tt>RsaWrapCtx</tt> MUST include the optional wrapped key information in the first
            manifest node that uses it.  The publisher MAY include the wrapped key in other manifest nodes.
            It MUST use distinct KeyNum for distinct <tt>WrappedKey</tt>.</t>

            <t>In a typical usage, the publisher would begin encryption at the root manifest.  It must
              include the full <tt>WrapedData</tt> here, as it is the first usage of the <tt>KeyNum</tt>.
              In subsequent manifests, the publisher may only include the <tt>AEADData</tt> in
              the <tt>RsaOaepData</tt> to save space.</t>

            <t>The <tt>KeyId</tt> identifies the KEK.  If the consumer already has the key
            corresponding to <tt>KeyId</tt> locally, it does not need to fetch it from the <tt>LocatorPrefixx</tt>.
            The <tt>KeyId</tt> is similar to the Content Object KeyId field <xref target="RFC8609"/>.</t>

          <t>The symmetric key MUST be one that is compatible with the AEAD Mode, i.e. a 128-bit or
            256-bit random number. Further, the symmetric key MUST fit in the OAEP envelope (which
            will be true for normal-sized keys).</t>

          <t>Any group key protocol and system needed are outside the scope of this document. We
            assume there is a Key Manager (KM) and a Publisher (P) and a set of group members.
            Through some means, the Publisher therefore has at its disposal:</t>
          <ul>
            <li>A Content Encryption Key (CEK), i.e. the symmetric key.</li>
            <li>The RSA-OAEP wrapped CEK.</li>
            <li>The KeyId of the KEK used to wrap the CEK.</li>
            <li>The Locator of the KEK, which is shared under some group key protocol.</li>
          </ul>

          <t>This specification requires that if a group member fetches the KEK key at
            Locator, it can decrypt the <tt>WrappedKey</tt>
            and retrieve the CEK.  The <tt>WrappedKey</tt>
            includes a 4-byte salt plus an AES key.  The 4-byte salt is used by the AEAD algorithm
            as part of the IV, and MUST remain the same for the given <tt>KeyNum</tt>.
          </t>

          <t>In one example, a publisher could request a key for a group and the Key Manager could
            securely communicate (<tt>CEK, Wapped_CEK, KeyId, Locator</tt>) back to the publisher.
            The Key Manager is responsible for publishing the Locator. In another example, the
            publisher could be a group member and have a group private key in which case the
            publisher can create their own key encryption key, publish it under the Locator and
            proceed. The publisher generates <tt>CEK, Wrapped_CEK, KeyId</tt>, and a Locator on its
            own.</t>

          <t>To create the wrapped key using a Key Encryption Key:</t>
          <ol>
            <li>Obtain the CEK in binary format (e.g. 32 bytes for 256 bits)</li>
            <li>RSA encrypt the <tt>WrappedKey</tt> value using the KEK public key with OAEP padding, following <xref
                target="RFC8017">RFC8017 Sec 7.1</xref>. The encryption is not signed because the
              root Manifest must have been signed by the publisher already.  Or the encapsulating
              Content Object (Data Object) is signed via ICN mechanisms.</li>
          </ol>

          <t>To decrypt the wrapped key using a Key Encryption Key:</t>
          <ol>
            <li>RSA decrypt the <tt>WrappedKey</tt> value using the KEK private key with OAEP padding, following
                <xref target="RFC8017" section="7.1" format="default"/>.</li>
            <li>Verify the unwrapped key is a valid length for the AEADMode.</li>
          </ol>

          <t>To encrypt a Manifest, the publisher:</t>
          <ol>
            <li>Acquires the set of (CEK, salt, WrappedKey, KeyId, Locator).  The publisher may
              generate these values itself, or acquire them from a key manager.</li>
            <li>Creates a <tt>SecurityCtx</tt> and adds it to the Manifest. The <tt>SecurityCtx</tt>
              includes an <tt>AEADNonce</tt> and <tt>AEADMode</tt>, as per AEAD mode.</li>
            <li>Encrypts the Manifest as per AEAD Mode using the RSA-OAEP SecurityCtx and CEK.</li>
          </ol>

          <t>To decrypt a Manifest, the consumer:</t>
          <ol>
            <li>Acquires the RSA private key corresponding to <tt>KeyId</tt> via the <tt>KeyLocator</tt>
            or whatever means the publisher and consumers use to distribute keys.</li>
            <li>It SHOULD verify that it trusts the Manifest publisher to use the provided key
              Locator.</li>
            <li>Decrypts the <tt>WrappedKey</tt> to get the CEK and salt. If the consumer has already decrypted the
              same exact WrappedKey TLV block, it may use that cached CEK and salt.</li>
            <li>Using the <tt>CEK</tt>, <tt>AEADNonce</tt>, and <tt>AEADMode</tt>, decrypt the
              Manifest as per AEAD Mode.</li>

                <section anchor="group" title="ECC Group Keys">
                    <t>NOTE: THIS IS INFORMALLY SPECIFIED AT THIS STAGE</t>
                    <t>
                        We use an EC group key that is encrypted for each user under their public key (also assumed EC) using
                        a standard NIST wrapping C(1e, 2s, ECC CDH)-ECDSA plus AES-KWP.  When a publisher wants to publish,
                        it creates an EC wrapping keypair and publishes the private key wrapped under the group key
                        (use C(1e, 1s, ECC CDH)-ECDSA plus AES-KWP).  Finally, the publisher starts creating master
                        secrets by creating ECDHE-ECDSA offers under the wapping key and using a KDF (e.g. HMAC-SHA256)
                        for the data key.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Note that the offer, in this case, is just an ephemeral EC public key plus the curve specification.
                        In compressed form that EC public key is only 48 bytes (SECP384R1), so the whole offer is maybe 60 bytes
                        including TLV encoding.  Compare that to an RSA 4096-bit encryption of a 32-byte AES key at 512 bytes.
                        That's over an 8x improvement.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The complete security context would be larger, as you still need the keyid of the wrapping key
                        (32 bytes) plus a link to the wrapping key content object.  Once someone has the wrapping key, they
                        can verify the key id and avoid fetching anything, then calculate the shared secret from the ECDHE
                        offer, then derive the data key using a KDF.   For IoT use cases, it would be useful to be able to
                        link to the whole offer.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The KDF is tied to input from the manifest, so the publisher can create many data keys so each
                        FLIC manifest tree has a different key all from the same master key derived from the wrapping key.
                        The offers could be embedded in the root manifest or published externally.  The preferred method
                        is to embed the offer in the root manifest.
                        When the group key changes, a publisher only needs to re-encrypt the wrapping keys.
                        It can save a lot of work depending on how many items it used the wrapping key under that group key.
                        For example, if the publisher uses only one wrapping key per group key, then they only need to re-encrypt one
                        thing for the new group to have access to the old data.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        This works with RSA keys too, though the specific algorithms change some.  We would use RSA-OAEP instead of
                        the ECDHE method.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        TODO: There are a variety of issues about how you name the keys and publish them.  We would also need to
                        decide if we want key fetching to be on-line or available from repos, and if so how to do current key fetching.

            <t>The Hash Naming Strategy uses CCNx nameless content objects and the HashSchema name constructor.  This means that
              only the Root Manifest should have a name embedded in the Content object.  All other

              The single prefix name should be different than the root manifest name, to not confuse
              them, as one may wish to use a discovery mechanism on the root manifest and fetch 
              it without a hash restriction.</t>

            <t>It proceeds as follows:</t>

          <section anchor="SegmentedPrefixStrategy">
            <name>CCNx Segmented Prefix Strategy</name>
            <t>The Segmented Prefix schema uses a different name in all Content Objects and
              distinguishes them via their ContentObjectHash. Note that in CCNx, using a
              SegmentedPrefixSchema means that only the Root Manifest has a Locator for
            the Segmented Prefix (minus the segment number).</t>
            <t>The SegmentedSchema uses name component suffix to distinguish each content object.
              This name component will be of type <tt>SuffixComponentType</tt>.  In CCNx, this
              would be a <tt>ChunkId</tt> or <tt>ManifestId</tt> type (<tt>ManifestId</tt> is
              defined in this document), though one may specify different types.  The reason
              for specifying the <tt>SuffixComponentType</tt> in the name definition is that
              application data would typically use chunked names with sequential identifiers and
              the FLIC manifest tree would typically use the <tt>ManifestId</tt>.</t>

              <t>A publisher may name the manifest tree and the application data as desired,
                as long as the consumer can generate the required name.  FLIC provides
                two mechanisms: <tt>AnnotatedPointers</tt> and <tt>StartSegmentId</tt>.
                One could use an annotated pointer to specify the exact name or name suffix for each pointer,
                so the consumer does not need to calculate anything; it simply uses the name specified.
                The downside is there is an annotation for each pointer, which reduces the number
                possible pointers in a given MTU.  The start segment id is a compact integer per
                hash group that indicates the beginning ID for the pointer array.  The consumer
                calculates each pointer's name suffix from the start segment ID plus pointer offset,
                and then wraps it in a name component of type <tt>SuffixComponentType</tt>.
              </t>

              <t>Because FLIC uses a preorder tree traversal, the node IDs in the traversal order
                are not compact.  They will skip around based on the preorder recursion.  This means
                one needs a different ID for each manifest if one wants to use the <tt>StartSegmentId</tt>
                hint.  A publisher may use any form of integer ID in the <tt>ManifestId</tt> name component
                so long as it is locally (within a hash group) sequential and globally unique.</t>

            <t>It proceeds as follows:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>The Root Manifest content object has a name used to fetch the manifest. It is
                signed by the publisher. It has a set of Locators used to fetch the remainder of the
                manifest. It has a single HashPointer that points to the Top Manifest. It may also
                have cache control directives, such as ExpiryTime.</li>

                be constructed from the SegmentedPrefixName plus a Chunk name component.</li>

              <li>The Top Manifest has the name SegmentedPrefixName plus chunk number. It may have
                cache control directies. It's GroupData elements must have an NsId that references

            This applies to any field in the grammar defined as "HashValue": <tt>T_SUBTREE_DIGEST, 
            T_LEAF_DIGEST, T_PTRS (an array of HashValue), T_PTR, T_KEYID</tt>.</t>

              <t>The CCNx encoding allows for vendor extensions (<tt>T_ORG</tt>) in several places,
              as per <xref target="RFC8609" section="3.3.2"/>.
              A parser may skip over any <tt>T_ORG</tt> it does not implement.  Where appropriate,
              we show an optional <tt>T_ORG</tt> tlv where allowed.</t>

              <t>The CCNx encoding allows for experimental type identifiers (0x1000-0x1FFF) in most
                TLV contexts.  A parser may skip over any experimental TLV it does not implement.
                We do not show experimental TLVs in the artwork below.</t>

                <t>There is no required order of TLV blocks withhin a TLV context.  We show the
                  RECOMMENDED ordering of TLV blocks.  TLV blocks MUST NOT repeat unless
                  specifically allowed in the <xref target="grammar">grammar</xref>.</t>

      <section anchor="tlv_manifest" title="Manifest TLV">
        <t>A Manifest has an outer TLV type that identifies type kind of manifest inside a Content Object
          with a payload type of <tt>T_PAYLOADTYPE_MANIFEST</tt>.  FLIC is defined as type <tt>T_FLIC_MANIFEST</tt>.</t>

          <t>A FLIC Manifest may be plaintext or encrypted.  A plaintext manifest usually only has a Node.
            But it may also have a Security Context, Node, and Authentication Tag.  This can happen when a manifest
            is in-place decrypted.  In place decryption operates on the body of the <tt>EncryptedNode</tt> TLV and
            then changes the type from <tt>T_ENCRYPTED_NODE</tt> to <tt>T_NODE</tt>.</t>

            <t>In NDN Hash Naming, a Data Object has a 0-length name. This means that an Interest

              <li>To form an Interest for a direct or indirect pointer, the name is only the
                Implicit Digest name component derived from a pointer's HashValue. The

          <t>When using CCNx Segmented Prefix Strategy or NDN Segmented Prefix strategy, the
          consumer must determine the segment number to use in the name.  There are
          two methods.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>If fetching a pointer with a SegmentIdAnnotation, the consumer MUST use that
              segment number for the pointer.  A pointer with SegmentIdAnnotation does not
              increment the SegmentId used by the GroupData case.</li>
            <li>If the GroupData has a StartSegmentId parameter, then that segment number MUST
              be used for the first in-order pointer of the group.  The consumer then increments
              the segment number for each in-order pointer of that group.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>Every group of a segmented NsId MUST have either a GroupData with a StartSegmentId, or
            use annotated pointers with SegmentIdAnnotation.</t>
          <t>A segment number MUST indicate exactly one data item.  That is, the producer
            MUST NOT duplicate the segment number in an object name for different objects.
            The object hash MUST be the same for the same segment number of a name.  </t>
          <t>It is allowed to have multiple manifest entries with the same segment number (see below).</t>
          <t>While a producer is allowed to mix using GroupData StartSegmentId and SegmentIdAnnotation,
            we in general do not consider that a good idea.  It is up to the manifest producer to ensure
            that every segment may be fetched, and fetch in the right order.
            Segments, when fetched in the <strong>manifest order</strong> reconstruct the original data.
          </t>
          <t>Let us make this clear, the original data is constructed by the in-order manifest retrieval, not
          the segment number order.  We recommend that the manifest in-order sequence SHOULD correspond
          to the segment number sequence.</t>
          <t>A consumer is not required to fetch every segment.  A consumer may fetch segments in any order
            it chooses.  It may skip around or omit segments.</t>
          <t>It is allowed to have multiple pointers to the same segment number.  This
          can be used for data de-duplication, e.g. multiple occurances of the same binary string within
          the reconstructed data object. If the producer uses this method, then the original data
          cannot be reconstructed by simply fetching the sequence numbers in order.</t>

            last pointer of (sub-) manifests. Such a tree becomes a sequential list of manifests
            with a maximum of datapointers per manifest packet. Beside the tree shape we also show
            this data structure in form of packet content where D stands for a data pointer and M is
            the hash of a manifest packet.</t>

      <name>Experimenting with FLIC</name>
      <t>FLIC is expected to enable a number of salient experiments in the use of ICN protools by
        applications. These experiments will help not only to inform the desirable structure of ICN
        applications but reflect back to the features included in FLIC to evaluate their usefulness
        to those applications. While many interesting design aspects of FLIC remain to be discovered
        through experience, a number of important questions to be answered through experimentation
        include:</t>
      <ul>
        <li>use for just files or other collections like directories</li>
        <li>use for particular applications, like streaming media manifests</li>
        <li>utility of pointer annotations to optimize retrieval</li>
        <li>utility of the encryption options for use by repositories and forwarders</li>
        <li>need for application metadata in manifests</li>

        <name>Locating FLIC leaf and manifest nodes</name>
        <t>The names of manifest and data objects are often missing or not unique, unless using
          specific naming conventions. In this example, we show how using manifest locators is used
          to generate Interests. Take for example the figure below where the root manifest is named
          by hash h0. It has nameless children with hashes with hashes h1 ... hN. </t>

...
nameless(dataN)                        - has hash hN

Query for the manifest:
interest(name=/a/b/c, implicitDigest=h0)
                ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>After obtaining the manifest, the client fetches the contents. In this first instance,
          the manifest does not provide any Locators data structure, so the client must continue
          using the name it used for the manifest.</t>

      <section anchor="Seeking">
        <name>Seeking</name>
        <t>Fast seeking (without having to sequentially fetch all content) works by skipping over
          entries for which we know their size. The following expression shows how to compute the
          byte offset of the data pointed at by pointer <tt>P_i</tt>, call it <tt>offset_i</tt>. In
          this formula, let <tt>P_i.size</tt> represent the Size value of the <em>i</em>-th
          pointer.</t>

        <sourcecode type="pseudocode"><![CDATA[offset_i = \sum_{k=1}^{i-1} &gt; P_k.size]]></sourcecode>

        <t>With this offset, seeking is done as follows:</t>
        <figure anchor="Seeking1"><name>Seeking Algorithm</name>
          <sourcecode type='pseudocode'><![CDATA[
Input: seek_pos P, a FLIC manifest with a hash group having N entries
Output: pointer index i and byte offset o, or out-of-range error
Algorithm:
offset = 0
for i in 1..N do
   if (P &gt; offset + P_i.size)
      return (i, P - offset)
   offset += P_i.size
return out-of-range
]]>
          </sourcecode>
        </figure>

        <t>Seeking in a BlockHashGroup is different since offsets can be quickly computed. This is
          because the size of each pointer P_i except the last is equal to the SizePerPtr value. For
          a BlockHashGroup with N pointers, OverallByteCount D, and SizePerPointer L, the size of
          P_N is equal to the following:</t>
        <artwork align="left" name="" type="" alt="">
<![CDATA[D - ((N - 1) * L)]]>
        </artwork>

        <t>In a BlockHashGroup with k pointers, the size of P_k is equal to:</t>
        <artwork align="left" name="" type="" alt="">
<![CDATA[D - L * (k - 1)]]>
        </artwork>

        <t>Using these, the seeking algorithm can be thus simplified to the following:</t>
        <figure anchor="Seeking2"><name>Seeking Algorithm</name>
          <sourcecode type='pseudocode'><![CDATA[
Input: seek_pos P, a FLIC manifest with a hash group having
                   OverallByteCount S and SizePerPointer L.
Output: pointer index i and byte offset o, or out-of-range error
Algorithm:
if (P > S)
   return out-of-range
i = floor(P / L)
if (i > N)
   return out-of-range # bad FLIC encoding
o = P mod L
return (i, o)]]>
          </sourcecode>
        </figure>

        <aside>
          <t><strong>Note</strong>: In both cases, if the pointer at position i is a manifest
            pointer, this algorithm has to be called once more, seeking to seek_pos o inside that
            manifest.</t>

      <section anchor="Republishing">
        <name>Re-publishing a FLIC under a new name</name>
        <t>There are several use cases for republishing a collection under a new namespace, or
          having one collection exist under several namespaces:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>It can happen that a publisher's namespace is part of a service provider's prefix.
            When switching provider, the publisher may want to republish the old data under a new
            name.</li>

          <li>A publishes wishes to distribute its content to several repositories and would like a
            result to be delivered from the repository for consumers who have good connectivity to
            that repository. For example, the publisher /alpha wishes to place content at /beta and
            /gamma, but routing only to /alpha would not send a request to either /beta or /gamma.
            The operators of of /beta and /gamma could create a named and signed version of the root
            manifest with appropriate keys (or delegate that to /alpha) so the results are always
            delivered by the corresponding repository without having to change the bulk of the
            manifest tree.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>This can easily be achieved with a single nameless root manifest for the large FLIC plus
          arbitrarily many per-name manifests (which are signed by whomever wants to publish this
          data):</t>

        </aside>

        <t>This example points out the problem of HashGroups having their own locator metadata
          elements: A retriever would be urged to follow these hints which are "hardcoded" deep
          inside the FLIC but might have become outdated. We therefore recommend to name FLIC
          manifests only at the highest level (where these names have no locator function). Child
          nodes in a FLIC manifest should not be named as these names serve no purpose except
          retrieving a sub-tree's manifest by name, if would be required. </t>

    <section anchor="IANA"><name>IANA Considerations</name>
      <t>FLIC adds two values to existing registries and defines a new registry in the 
        "Content-Centric Networking (CCNx)" group.  The first table defines FLIC as
        manifest type 0x0000.  Other manifest types could be defined in the future.
        The remaining sub-registries define values specific to FLIC.</t>

        <t>The FLIC registries follow the CCNx convention of reserving the namespace 0x1000 - 0x1FFF
          for experimental use.  It also uses the T_ORG (0x0FFF) definition for organizational
          (vendor) extensions in the <tt>NodeData</tt> and <tt>GroupData</tt> fields.</t>

      <t>IANA will assign value "0x0004" to "T_MANIFEST_ID" in the "CCNx Name Segment Types" registry.</t>

      <section>
        <name>Integrity and Origin Authentication of FLIC Manifests</name>
        <t>A FLIC Manifest is used to describe how to form Interests to access large CCNx or NDN
          application data. The Manifest is itself either an individual content object, or a tree of
          content objects linked together via the corresponding content hashes. The NDN and CCnx
          protocol architectures directly provide both individual object integrity (using
          cryptographically strong hashes) and data origin authentication (using signatures). The
          protocol specifications, <xref target="NDN"/> and <xref target="RFC8609">CCNx</xref>
          respectively, provide the protocol machinery and keying to support strong integrity and
          authentication. Therefore, FLIC utilizes the existing protocol specifications for these
          functions, rather than providing its own. There are a few subtle differences in the
          handling of signatures and keys in NDN and CCNx worth recapitulating here:</t>
        <ul>
          <li>NDN in general adds a signature to every individual data packet rather than
            aggregating signatures via some object-level scheme. When employing FLIC Manifests to
            multi-packet NDN objects, it is expected that the individual packet signatures would be
            elided and the signture on the Manifest used instead.</li>
          <li>In contrast, CCNx is biased to have primitive objects or pieces thereof be "nameless"
            in the sense they are identified only by their hashes rather than each having a name
            directly bound to the content through an individual signature. Therefore, CCNx depends
            heavily on FLIC (or an alternative method) to provide the name and the signed binding of
            the name to the content described in the Manifest</li>
        </ul>
        <t>A FLIC Manifest therefore gets integrity of its individual pieces through the existing
          secure hashing procedures of the underlying protocols. Origin authentication of the entire
          Manifest is achieved through hash chaining and applying a signature <strong>only</strong>
          to the root Manifest of a manifest tree. It is important to note that the Name of the
          Manifest, which is what the signature is bound to, need not bear any particular
          relationship to the names of the application objects pointed to in the Manifest via Name
          Constructors. This has a number of important benefits described in <xref
            target="nameconstructors"/>.</t>

      <section>
        <name>Confidentiality of Manifest Data</name>
        <t>ICN protocol architectures like CCNx and NDN, while providing integrity and origin
          authentication as described above, leaves confidentiality issues entirely in the domain of
          the ICN application. Therefore, since FLIC is an application-level construct in both NDN
          and CCNx, it is incumbent on this specification for FLIC to provide the desired
          confidentiality properties using encryption. One could leave the specification of Manifest
          encryption entirely in the hands of the individual application utilizing FLIC, but this
          would be undesirable for a number of reasons:</t>
        <ul>
          <li>The sensitivity of the information in a Manifest may be different from the sensitivity
            of the application data it describes. In some cases, it may not be necessary to encrypt
            manifests, or to encrypt them with a different keying scheme from that used for the
            application data</li>
          <li>One of the major capabilities enabled by FLIC is to allow repositories or forwarding
            caches to operate on Manifests (see in particular <xref target="metadata"/>). In order
            to allow such intermediaries to interpret manifests without revealing the underlying
            application data, separate encryption and keying is necessary</li>
          <li>A strong design goal of FLIC is <em>universality</em> such that it can be used
            transparently by many different ICN applications. This argues that FLIC should have a
            set of common encryption and keying capabilities that can be delegated to library code
            and not have to be re-worked by each individual application (see <xref
              target="libraries"/>)</li>
        </ul>

        <t>Therefore, this specification directly specifies two encryption encapsulations and
          associated links to key management, as described in <xref target="encryption"/>. As more
          experience is gained with various use cases, additional encryption capabilities may be
          needed and hence we expect the encryption aspects of this specification to evolve over
          time.</t>

      <name>Building Trees</name>
      <t>This appendix describes one method to build trees. It constructs a pre-order tree in a
        single pass of the application data, going from the tail to the beginning. This allows us to
        work up the right side of the tree in a single pass, then work down each left branch until
        we exhaust the data. Using the reverse-order traversal, we create the right-most-child
        manifest, then its parent, then the indirect pointers of that parent, then the parent's
        direct pointers,then the parent of the parent (repeating). This process uses recursion, as
        it is the clearest way to show the code. A more optimized approach could do it in a true
        single pass.</t>

      <t>Because we're building from the bottom up, we use the term 'level' to be the distance from
        the right-most child up. Level 0 is the bottom-most level of the tree, such as where node 7
        is:</t>

reverse:  7 6 3 5 4 2 1
                ]]></artwork>

      <t>The Python-like pseudocode build_tree(data, n, k, m) algorithm creates a tree of n data
        objects. The data[] array is an array of Content Objects that hold application payload; the
        application data has already been packetized into n Content Object packets.An interior
        manifest node has k direct pointers and m indirect pointers.</t>
